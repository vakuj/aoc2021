### Part 1

Determine the horizontal position that the crabs can align to using the least fuel possible. How much fuel must they spend to align to that position?

### Example

For example, consider the following horizontal positions:

`16,1,2,0,4,2,7,1,2,14`

This means there's a crab with horizontal position 16, a crab with horizontal position 1, and so on.

Each change of 1 step in horizontal position of a single crab costs 1 fuel. You could choose any horizontal position to align them all on, but the one that costs the least fuel is horizontal position 2:

* Move from 16 to 2: 14 fuel
* Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel
* Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
* Move from 0 to 2: 2 fuel
* Move from 4 to 2: 2 fuel
* Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
* Move from 7 to 2: 5 fuel
* Move from 1 to 2: 1 fuel
* Move from 2 to 2: 0 fuel
* Move from 14 to 2: 12 fuel

This costs a total of 37 fuel. This is the cheapest possible outcome; more expensive outcomes include aligning at position 1 (41 fuel), position 3 (39 fuel), or position 10 (71 fuel).
